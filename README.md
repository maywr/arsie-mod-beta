## why
I started leaning java just for making some minecraft things (like clients, plugins etc), so this is my first not pasted and custom base client :)

## building
To build client yourself you can use:

```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
```
gradlew build
```
Also don't forget that if you want to build the client you need some things like:
* jdk 8 
* a brain if you see errors in your build.


## TODO
* settings 
* config
* target renders
* more cool gui renders
* fixing crashes
* main menu shaders

## credits
* mrnv for glslmenu shader rendering
* aurora client for render util & gui move
* amfero for custom font renderer from razmorozka 

## contributing
I will be glad to see you making changes to the client and creating a pull request!

WARNING: **The code might be a little bit bad because this is my first time making a client**
